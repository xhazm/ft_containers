# ft_containers - 42 Heilbronn(February 2023)

## Description
My personal implementation of some of the container class templates from the C++ standard template library (STL). This also included the corresponding iterator systems as well as the required utilities. 

The goal was to get a better understanding of the internal functionality of the different holder objects and the tradeoffs in complexity involved. 
 
Containers:
[`vector`],  [`map`],  [`stack`], [`set`]

Utils :
[`iterator_traits`], [`iterators`], [`reverse_iterator`], [`enable_if`], [`is_integral`], [`equal`], [`lexicographical_compare`], [`pair`],  [`make_pair`]

## Implementation

To facilitate full interoperability between my containers and the STL algorithms I was following the original implementation of the STL source code closely. A good overview over the required member functions and their declarations was provided by [cplusplus.com]. To guarantee time complexity comparable to the STL containers an auto-balancing [Red-Black Tree] was chosen as the underlying data structure for map and set. The  entire code is written in accordance to the C++98 standard.
  
## Testing
To check my own implementation against the original STL version, a test file, which tests for runtime and function is included.
